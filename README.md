# MiSTer_FGC_Pack
A ready to use pack of MRAs and Saves to have easier Versus Play for (Mostly) Fighting Games on the MiSTer.

# Torunament MRAs
A set of MRAs intended for tournament use.
Region Version is the tournament preferred version for each game.
'Core Credits' Button has been removed to avoid accidental button settings and pauses from users less familiar with the MiSTer.

# Saves
A set of GBA Saves for full unlocks of multiplayer games.
The saves have been converted into saves for the GBA2P core.
Saves were aquired from various uploads by users on Zophars Domain and Gamefaqs. 
All credits for the saves are in the GBA_Credits text file.
If you would like to have your save removed from the pack or have a save to contribute please contact me.

# Script
Please add the below line of code to your downloader.ini file if you would like to have your MiSTer automatically download these files, and any updates when they occur.
