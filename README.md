# MiSTer_FGC_Pack
A ready to use pack of MRAs and Saves to have easier Versus Play for *(Mostly)* Fighting Games on the MiSTer.

### Torunament MRAs
A set of MRAs intended for tournament use.
Region Version is the tournament preferred version for each game.
'Core Credits' Button has been removed to avoid accidental button settings and pauses from users less familiar with the MiSTer.

- Copy the _Tournament folder inside your _Arcade folder to use.
- Romhacks are any romhacks that major changes to the point it could be considered their own game.
- QOL_Romhacks are any romhacks that make only minor changes such as unlocking characters or visual changes.

### Saves
A set of GBA Saves for full unlocks of multiplayer games.
The saves have been converted into saves for the GBA2P core.
- Copy the GBA and GBA2P Folders to your saves folder to use


*Planning to expand to cover other consoles as needed*

### Thanks
Thank you to **Jotego** for your work at developing the CPS1 and CPS2 cores as well as your future projects. 
These cores are allowing tournament play for these games to become more accessible.

Thank you to **Atrac17** for creating the Arcade Offsets. 
This has made it easier to play great HB Projects like SF2'Mix as well as giving more training tools on these accurate cores.

Thank you to **FPGAzumSpass** for your development of various cores, but especially the GBA2P core.
So many multiplayer games have become accessible thanks to this core, allowing more people to experience games they otherwise would never have played.

Thank you to the users of **Zophars Domain** and **GameFAQs**. 
Many people have put in work to share to GBA Save files and it's great to have easy access to all characters in various fighting games.
Specific users from these 2 communities are credited in the [GBA_Credits](GBA_Credits.txt) file.
If for any reason you would like to have your save removed from the Pack please contact me.
